# Solution to the puzzle

1.	Give 100 bottle to each one of the prisoners i.e., 1-100 bottles to 1st prisoner, 101-200 bottles to 2nd prisoner, 201-300 to 3rd prisoner, and so on
    and ask them to drink some amount of wine from each of the bottles.
    
2.	Then after 7 days check which prisoner dies and select only those 100 bottles and let king drink from the rest of the bottles. For example: Prisoner 1 dies,
    select 1-100 bottles. (9 Prisoners left)
    
3.	Then give 1-20 bottle to 1st prisoner, 21-40 to 2nd prisoner, 41-60 to 3rd prisoner, 61-80 to 4th prisoner and 81-100 bottles to 5th prisoner. In this we used 5 prisoners.

4.	Now again after 7 days check which prisoner dies and select only those 20 bottles. For example: Prisoner 2 dies, select 41-60 bottles. (8 Prisoners left)

5.	Now give 5 bottles to each of the prisoner. In this we used 4 prisoners.

6.	Now again check which prisoner dies after 7 days and select only those 5 bottles. (7 Prisoners left)

7.	Now give 1 bottle to each of the five prisoners. In this we used 5 prisoners.

8.	Finally, after 7 days, check which prisoner dies, select that bottle and now we can say the its is the poisoned one. (6 Prisoners left)


# In this way we can find the poisoned one bottle!
